# /ticket-triage

> Use only support, knowledge-base, and project-tracker sources that are actually available and authorized in the host. State clearly when a source was not checked.

Categorize, prioritize, and route an incoming support ticket or customer issue. Produces a structured triage assessment with a suggested initial response.

When checking public documentation or known-issue evidence, read [the SandBase API map](references/sandbase-api-map.md). Resolve the current schema with `sandbase_describe_tool` before using a listed capability through `sandbase_call_tool`.

## Usage

```
/ticket-triage <ticket text, customer message, or issue description>
```

Examples:
- `/ticket-triage Customer says their dashboard has been showing a blank page since this morning`
- `/ticket-triage "I was charged twice for my subscription this month"`
- `/ticket-triage User can't connect their SSO — getting a 403 error on the callback URL`
- `/ticket-triage Feature request: they want to export reports as PDF`

## Workflow

### 1. Parse the Issue

Read the input and extract:

- **Core problem**: What is the customer actually experiencing?
- **Symptoms**: What specific behavior or error are they seeing?
- **Customer context**: Who is this? Any account details, plan level, or history available?
- **Urgency signals**: Are they blocked? Is this production? How many users affected?
- **Emotional state**: Frustrated, confused, matter-of-fact, escalating?

### 2. Categorize and Prioritize

Using the category taxonomy and priority framework below:

- Assign a **primary category** (bug, how-to, feature request, billing, account, integration, security, data, performance) and an optional secondary category
- Assign a **priority** (P1–P4) based on impact and urgency
- Identify the **product area** the issue maps to

### 3. Check for Duplicates and Known Issues

Before routing, check available sources:

- **Support platform**: Search for similar open or recently resolved tickets when available
- **Knowledge base**: Check for known issues or existing documentation when available
- **Project tracker**: Check if there's an existing bug report or feature request when available

Apply the duplicate detection process below.
If none of these sources is available, mark duplicate and known-issue status as `Not checked`; never report “no duplicate” merely because no search was run.

### 4. Determine Routing

Using the routing rules below, recommend which team or queue should handle this based on category and complexity.

### 5. Generate Triage Output

```
## Triage: [One-line issue summary]

**Category:** [Primary] / [Secondary if applicable]
**Priority:** [P1-P4] — [Brief justification]
**Product area:** [Area/team]

### Issue Summary
[2-3 sentence summary of what the customer is experiencing]

### Key Details
- **Customer:** [Name/account if known]
- **Impact:** [Who and what is affected]
- **Workaround:** [Available / Not available / Unknown]
- **Related tickets:** [Links to similar issues if found]
- **Known issue:** [Yes — link / No — searched sources / Not checked / Checking]

### Routing Recommendation
**Route to:** [Team or queue]
**Why:** [Brief reasoning]

### Suggested Initial Response
[Draft first response to the customer — acknowledge the issue,
set expectations, provide workaround if available.
Use the auto-response templates below as a starting point.]

### Internal Notes
- [Any additional context for the agent picking this up]
- [Reproduction hints if it's a bug]
- [Escalation triggers to watch for]
```

### 6. Offer Next Steps

After presenting the triage:
- "Want me to draft a full response to the customer?"
- "Should I search for more context on this issue?"
- "Want me to check if this is a known bug in the tracker?"
- "Should I prepare an escalation package with the available evidence?"

## Category Taxonomy

Assign every ticket a **primary category** and optionally a **secondary category**:

| Category | Description | Signal Words |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Bug** | Product is behaving incorrectly or unexpectedly | Error, broken, crash, not working, unexpected, wrong, failing |
| **How-to** | Customer needs guidance on using the product | How do I, can I, where is, setting up, configure, help with |
| **Feature request** | Customer wants a capability that doesn't exist | Would be great if, wish I could, any plans to, requesting |
| **Billing** | Payment, subscription, invoice, or pricing issues | Charge, invoice, payment, subscription, refund, upgrade, downgrade |
| **Account** | Account access, permissions, settings, or user management | Login, password, access, permission, SSO, locked out, can't sign in |
| **Integration** | Issues connecting to third-party tools or APIs | API, webhook, integration, connect, OAuth, sync, third-party |
| **Security** | Security concerns, data access, or compliance questions | Data breach, unauthorized, compliance, GDPR, SOC 2, vulnerability |
| **Data** | Data quality, migration, import/export issues | Missing data, export, import, migration, incorrect data, duplicates |
| **Performance** | Speed, reliability, or availability issues | Slow, timeout, latency, down, unavailable, degraded |

### Category Determination Tips

- If the customer reports **both** a bug and a feature request, the bug is primary
- If they can't log in due to a bug, category is **Bug** (not Account) — root cause drives the category
- "It used to work and now it doesn't" = **Bug**
- "I want it to work differently" = **Feature request**
- "How do I make it work?" = **How-to**
- When in doubt, lean toward **Bug** — it's better to investigate than dismiss

## Priority Framework

Use the organization's documented SLA when available. The response times below are illustrative defaults and should not be presented as a customer commitment unless authorized.

### P1 — Critical
**Criteria:** Production system down, data loss or corruption, security breach, all or most users affected.

- The customer cannot use the product at all
- Data is being lost, corrupted, or exposed
- A security incident is in progress
- The issue is worsening or expanding in scope

**SLA expectation:** Respond within 1 hour. Continuous work until resolved or mitigated. Updates every 1-2 hours.

### P2 — High
**Criteria:** Major feature broken, significant workflow blocked, many users affected, no workaround.

- A core workflow is broken but the product is partially usable
- Multiple users are affected or a key account is impacted
- The issue is blocking time-sensitive work
- No reasonable workaround exists

**SLA expectation:** Respond within 4 hours. Active investigation same day. Updates every 4 hours.

### P3 — Medium
**Criteria:** Feature partially broken, workaround available, single user or small team affected.

- A feature isn't working correctly but a workaround exists
- The issue is inconvenient but not blocking critical work
- A single user or small team is affected
- The customer is not escalating urgently

**SLA expectation:** Respond within 1 business day. Resolution or update within 3 business days.

### P4 — Low
**Criteria:** Minor inconvenience, cosmetic issue, general question, feature request.

- Cosmetic or UI issues that don't affect functionality
- Feature requests and enhancement ideas
- General questions or how-to inquiries
- Issues with simple, documented solutions

**SLA expectation:** Respond within 2 business days. Resolution at normal pace.

### Priority Escalation Triggers

Automatically bump priority up when:
- Customer has been waiting longer than the SLA allows
- Multiple customers report the same issue (pattern detected)
- The customer explicitly escalates or mentions executive involvement
- A workaround that was in place stops working
- The issue expands in scope (more users, more data, new symptoms)

## Routing Rules

Route tickets based on category and complexity:

| Route to | When |
|----------|------|
| **Tier 1 (frontline support)** | How-to questions, known issues with documented solutions, billing inquiries, password resets |
| **Tier 2 (senior support)** | Bugs requiring investigation, complex configuration, integration troubleshooting, account issues |
| **Engineering** | Confirmed bugs needing code fixes, infrastructure issues, performance degradation |
| **Product** | Feature requests with significant demand, design decisions, workflow gaps |
| **Security** | Data access concerns, vulnerability reports, compliance questions |
| **Billing/Finance** | Refund requests, contract disputes, complex billing adjustments |

## Duplicate Detection

Before creating a new ticket or routing, check available sources for duplicates:

1. **Search by symptom**: Look for tickets with similar error messages or descriptions
2. **Search by customer**: Check if this customer has an open ticket for the same issue
3. **Search by product area**: Look for recent tickets in the same feature area
4. **Check known issues**: Compare against documented known issues

**If a duplicate is found:**
- Recommend linking the new ticket to the existing one
- Draft a customer notification that this is a known issue being tracked
- Recommend adding any new information from the new report to the existing ticket
- Bump priority if the new report adds urgency (more customers affected, etc.)

Perform those external updates only when the user explicitly requests and authorizes them.

## Auto-Response Templates by Category

an answer for you within [timeframe]."]
```

### Security — Initial Response
```
Thank you for flagging this — we take security concerns
seriously and are reviewing this immediately.

[If action is needed: "In the meantime, we recommend
[protective action]."]
```

## Triage Best Practices

1. Read the full ticket before categorizing — context in later messages often changes the assessment
2. Categorize by **root cause**, not just the symptom described
3. When in doubt on priority, err on the side of higher — it's easier to de-escalate than to recover from a missed SLA
4. Check available sources for duplicates and known issues before routing; otherwise mark the check as not performed
5. Write internal notes that help the next person pick up context quickly
6. Include what you've already checked or ruled out to avoid duplicate investigation
7. Flag patterns — if you're seeing the same issue repeatedly, escalate the pattern even if individual tickets are low priority
