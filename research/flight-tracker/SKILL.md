# Flight Tracker

Track flight status, delays, gate changes, and estimated arrival times for any commercial flight. Covers real-time flight tracking, schedule lookup, and delay monitoring for travel coordination and logistics planning. Read [the API map](references/sandbase-api-map.md) before selecting a capability.

## Call SandBase capabilities

Use the capability identifiers below as discovery hints, not MCP tool names. Find the matching endpoint with `sandbase_discover(q: "<provider and capability>")`; use its returned `name` in `sandbase_inspect(name: "<returned name>")`. Read `inputSchema`, pricing, and `execute_as`, then call `sandbase_run` using `execute_as.arguments.name` and schema-defined `arguments`. If a `run_id` is returned, poll `sandbase_run_get(run_id: "<returned run_id>")` within the task budget until `completed` or `failed`; report pending or failed runs without resubmitting them automatically.

## Capability identifiers

- `strale_flight_status`

## Workflow

1. Understand the user's research question, target, and context.
2. Resolve each selected capability with `sandbase_discover`, then inspect the returned `name` with `sandbase_inspect` to confirm the schema and pricing.
3. Follow `execute_as` with `sandbase_run`; collect async results with `sandbase_run_get` as described above.
4. Synthesize findings into a clear, evidence-backed answer.
5. Cite sources, note evidence gaps, and separate observations from interpretations.

## Guidelines

- Always call `sandbase_inspect` before using any capability.
- Cite sources and preserve attribution (URLs, usernames, dates, metrics).
- Separate factual observations from analysis and recommendations.
- If data is unavailable, note the gap and continue with available evidence.
- Read-only research only. Never take actions on platforms.
